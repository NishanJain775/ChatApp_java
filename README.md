# ChatApp_java
Interface of Chatapp is looking something that i had runnned over my local laptop.
I had used many concepts of networking and Socket programming in this project, and here i used JAVA as programming language for the complete project.

I had also implented this chatApp working on two different machines/ laptops and it is working smoothly just by changing the Ip Addresses according to machines in side the our existing code.
